# josephus-scrambler
This scrambler was produced as a demo of how Josephus's Problem's periodic can be used in image encryption via scrambling. 

<ReadMe Incomplete>
//Last minute idea - maybe no one will care about this code. But yes best to specify where to add image directory and which function to interact with to encrypt an image.

Limitations:
- haven't figured outa way to undo the scrambling, but because it's based on a regenratable pattern it can be inevitably traced back / undone.
- Only scrambles in one axes (but suffices nonetheless for demonstrative purposes).
